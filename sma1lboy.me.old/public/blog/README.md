Hello there! I'm Jackson Chen, also known as @Sma1lboy on GitHub.

This blog is where I share my thoughts, experiences, and insights on software development, technology trends, personal growth. Whether you're a fellow developer, a tech enthusiast, or just someone curious about Dev. I hope you'll find something interesting and valuable here.

Feel free to explore my articles, and don't hesitate to open an issue on GitHub if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to start a discussion. Your feedback and interactions are always welcome!

Somehow, because I often prefer to speak Chinese (I plan to put more time on English learning after I graduate from undergrad), I write unfinished articles in Chinese to help me organize my thoughts.

Happy reading, and let's learn and grow together!
