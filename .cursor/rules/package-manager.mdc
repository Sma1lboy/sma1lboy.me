# Package Manager Rules

## Use Bun Instead of NPM

This project uses **bun** as the package manager instead of npm. Always use bun commands for package management tasks.

### Commands to Use:
- `bun install` instead of `npm install`
- `bun add <package>` instead of `npm install <package>`
- `bun remove <package>` instead of `npm uninstall <package>`
- `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>`
- `bun dev` instead of `npm run dev`
- `bun build` instead of `npm run build`

### Project Configuration:
- Lock file: [bun.lockb](mdc:bun.lockb) (binary format)
- Package file: [package.json](mdc:package.json)
- No `package-lock.json` should be created

### Development Workflow:
1. Use `bun install` to install dependencies
2. Use `bun dev` to start the development server
3. Use `bun add` to add new packages
4. Always commit the `bun.lockb` file with changes

### Performance Benefits:
- Faster installation and execution
- Better TypeScript support out of the box
- Improved development experience
