# Development Server Policy

## ðŸš« Critical Rule: Never Start Development Servers

The AI assistant must **NEVER** start, restart, or manage development servers under any circumstances.

### Prohibited Commands
- `bun run dev`
- `npm run dev` 
- `yarn dev`
- `pnpm dev`
- `vite`
- `next dev`
- `nuxt dev`
- Any command that starts a development server

### Why This Rule Exists
- Development servers can cause system performance issues
- Multiple server instances can conflict with each other
- Server management should be handled by the user directly
- Background processes can consume unnecessary resources

### What the AI Can Do Instead
- âœ… Read and analyze code files
- âœ… Make code changes and edits
- âœ… Install dependencies with package managers
- âœ… Run build commands (`bun run build`)
- âœ… Run tests (`bun test`)
- âœ… Check server status with `curl` or similar tools
- âœ… Kill existing processes if needed (`pkill`)

### User Responsibility
- The user will start and manage their own development servers
- The user will verify that applications are running correctly
- The user will handle port conflicts and server issues

### Exception Handling
If the user explicitly requests to start a development server, the AI should:
1. Acknowledge the request
2. Explain this policy
3. Suggest that the user start the server manually
4. Provide the correct command for them to run

**Remember: Development server management is the user's responsibility, not the AI's.**
